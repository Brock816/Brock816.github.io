<h1>The Rivers of Our Planet</h1>
<p1><font size="6"> Rio Grande River </p1><br>
  <p2><font size="5"><strong>The Rio grande is the fifth longest river in North America.
It begins in the Rocky Mountains and flows into the Gulf of Mexico.
In addition, Rio Grande has been the border between Texas and Mexico; the area is still in dispute between Mexico and the United States.
The Rio grande is vital for farming, as it supplies water for more than 2 Million acres of farmland. If you are able to, please donate to conserve this river.<strong></p2><br>
