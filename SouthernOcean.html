    <h1>The Oceans of Our Planet</h1>
    <p1><font size="6"> <strong>Southern Ocean<strong> </p1><br>
      <p2><font size="5"><strong> The Southern Ocean is most well known for its extreme weather conditions, wildlife and icebergs.
    It is home to plenty of wildlife, including penguins and the largest whale on the planet, the blue whale.
    Furthermore, this ocean is made up of mostly deep areas with very few shallow depths. As a matter of fact, the average depths of what makes most of this ocean range from 13,000 to 16,000 feet.
    The climate in this ocean can be extreme at times, with temperatures that can drop below 10 degrees celsius!
    Please donate to help save preserve the amazing wildlife.<strong></p2><br>
