<h1>The Rivers of Our Planet</h1>
<p1><font size="6"> Mississippi River </p1><br>
  <p2><font size="5">The Mississippi River expands for more than 2340 miles.
In addition, it contains the third largest watershed in the world.
This river is home to 360 species of fish, 326 species of birds, 145 species of amphibians and 50 species of mammals.
The deepest part of the River is 200 feet and it is located near the end of the river, around New Orleans.
The Mississippi River has many catfish farms along the river.
We must protect the Mississippi River by donating money to ensure that the history and wildlife can live there for a long as possible.
