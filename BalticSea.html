The Baltic Sea is considered relatively young because it has only been formed for 14 thousand years.
The Baltic Sea contains a mixture of salt and freshwater. Baltic sea being a brackish mix of water makes a special sea.
The Baltic Sea can also completely freeze, although super rare, certain weather conditions can make it a huge ice rink on parts of it.
The conditions and the brackish water contribute to the types of wildlife that live there. Sharks are able to live in such conditions, but a dolphin cannot.
The Balitic Sea is most known for its coastal features which includes the beautiful beaches and the calm waters.
Help by donating to preserve the amazing creatures that live in the Baltic sea including the grey seal, harbour seal, ringed seal and the harbour porpoise.
