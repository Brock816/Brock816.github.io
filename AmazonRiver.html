It has many species that have been undiscovered and scientists often explore it for research.
This river holds one fifth of all the fresh water that enters oceans on Earth!
The Amazon is home to many unique species including a variety of crocodiles, fish, snakes, and dolphins. Unique species would include piranhas, the amazon river dolphin, and the anaconda.
Since the Amazon is a rainforest, the weather conditions can get extremely humid and hot.
The Amazon River is well known for its vast rainforest and long river that provide many things including transportation, food and new discoveries.
