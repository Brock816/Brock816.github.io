  <p2><font size="5"><strong>
Over 1200 species of organisms and plants live in the Red Sea.
There have been volcanic islands rise from the center of the Sea.
The first explorers that have been proved to explore the red sea were the ancient egyptians.
Most of the red sea is relatively shallow under 330 feet.
The red sea is most known for the hot and salty water that it contains.
Donate money to help preserve these beautiful animals that live in the red sea including spinner dolphins, dugongs, turtles, mantas, and sharks.
