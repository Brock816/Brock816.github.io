    <h1>The Lakes and Seas of Our Planet</h1>
    <p1><font size="6">Great Lakes </p1><br>
      <p2><font size="5"><strong>The five great lakes consist of the Superior, Huron, Michigan, Ontario, and Erie seas.
    These seas combined take up 95,160 square miles, making up a fifth of the world's freshwater surface.
    Over 3,500 species currently inhabit the Great Lakes basin.
    It's a popular spot for boating, as well as fishing, and serves as a means of transportation for goods.
    Around 14,000 years ago, these lakes were covered by a glacier, however, about 10,00 years ago, the glacier melted, leaving behind the form of the lakes that we see today.
    There are over 140 federal programs designed to restore and manage the lakes, and you can contribute to these programs as well with a donation.
