<h1>The Lakes and Seas of our Planet</h1>
<br>
<p1><font size="6"> Caspian Sea: </p1><br><br>
  <p2><font size="5"><strong>
The Caspian Sea is landlocked between Asia and Russia.
The Caspian Sea is unique in a way because a canal is connected to it that leads to the Sea of Azov.
Many people rule the Casipian sea as the largest lake on earth even though it is not a lake because it is not composed of freshwater.
This Sea is used a lot to be able to obtain oil. The caspian sea produces so much oil that it is equivalent to the production that the country of Brazil comes up with.
The Caispian Sea is home to many types of fish including sturgeon, salmon, herring as well as types of seals.
Donate please to preserve this canal route as well as the amazing creatures that live in this Sea.
