<h1>The Rivers of Our Planet</h1>
<p1><font size="6"> Nile River </p1><br>
  <p2><font size="5"><strong>The Nile is the longest river on the planet. It is over 6700 kilometers in length!
The Nile was vital in the building of the pyramids, as the blocks were transported through the river.
Nile River Delta is home to many species of animals, including crocodiles, turtles, baboons, wildebeest, and over 300 species of birds, those of which include fishing eagles, ibis, and the Nile Valley Sunbird.
During the ancient egypt era, the river was used for agriculture and a source of transportation.
To this day, the Nile is still a lifeline for many villagers and stands as a huge part of history.
To help preserve its legacy, as well as the people and animals that live there, we need donations from people like you.</p2><br><strong>
